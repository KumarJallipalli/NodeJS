- `Node.js`  â†’ Node JS is a JavaScript Runtime built on Chromeâ€™s V8 JS Engine

NOTE:

---

- To Run/Execute JS Code, we require JS Engine
    - Without JS Engine, we CANNOT run/execute JS Code
    - i.e., wherever there is JS running, There is a JS Engine

## History of Node JS

- Ryan Dahl Created Node JS in 2009
    - Initially, Node is built using on Spider Monkey [ Firefoxâ€™s JS Engine ]
    - Later [ After 2 days ], It was switched to use Chromeâ€™s V8 Engine
- Joyent is also developing JS Engine which is similar to Ryan Dahlâ€™s JS Engine
    - Hence, They Offered Ryan Dahl to become a Part of the Project
- Initially, Node JS is named as `Web.js` as it was meant to Create Web Server
    - Later, It was Termed as Node JS due to itâ€™s usages outside of Web Server
- Why Node JS is Developed..?
    - Earlier, there is Apache HTTP Server, which is a Blocking Server
    - Hence, To Create a Non-Blocking Server, Node JS is developed
- In 2010, NPM is Developed by Isaac [ from Joyent ]
- In 2011, Windows Support to Node JS is Released [ Joint Collab between Joyent & MS ]
    - Until then, Node is Available only to MacOS & Linux
- In 2012, Dahl left the Project & is Handed over to Isaac [ Creator of NPM ]
    - Until now, Node JS is completely Manage by Joyent & is Open Source
    - But Update on Node JS is poor [ Not able to catch up with V8 Engine ]
- In 2014, Node JS is Forked into `io.js` by Fedor
- In 2015, Both Node JS & IO JS are Merged into Todayâ€™s Node JS & is Maintained by NodeJS Foundation
- In 2019, JS Foundation & NodeJS Foundation are Merged to form Open JS Foundation [ Looked over by Linux Foundation ]
- Currently, Node JS is Handled by Open JS Foundation
