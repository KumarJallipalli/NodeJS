## Overview of JS

In Earlier Days, Everything is used to be taught in Browserâ€™s Console. 

Why..?

- Because, There is NO other way to Execute the JS Code other than Browser
    - Browser contains JavaScript engine [ i.e., it parses and executes JavaScript code ]
    - And this JS Engine is only available within Browserâ€™s â†’ No Standalone JS Engine
- Hence, everything is used to be taught in Browserâ€™s Console

Later, 

- A guy named Dahl created a Standalone version of this called Node.JS
- So that we can execute JS code even outside the Browser

## Use Case

In Earlier Days, 

- As JS can only be Executed inside the Browser,
- It is used only for building Interactive Web Pages
    - i.e., Front End Web Apps

Now, 

- As JS can be Executed anywhere,
- It is used in Building
    - Backend [ building Servers ]
    - Desktop Apps [ talk to Desktop hardware & become Desktop App â†’ Electron ]
    - Mobile Apps [ talk to Mobile hardware & become Desktop App â†’ React Native ]
    - etc..

NOTE:

---

- Major Drawback of Coding JS in Browser is â†’ It is Non Persistent Code
- Hence, we write JS code in Separate Files â†’ To make Code Persistent
