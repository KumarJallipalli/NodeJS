# 1.6 Loops [ 22/08/2025 ]

---

## Loops

- loops are used to iterate over a piece of code
- i.e., execute a piece of code multiple times without repetition of the code
- Loops used to control the flow of program

NOTE:

---

- Whatever the input given by user in prompt, it is taken & stored as a string only
- A `program` is a set of instructions given to a computer to perform a specific task
</aside>

## For Loop

Syntax of `for` loops is

```jsx
for ( initialization; condition; updation ) {
	//piece of code
}

/*
	Initialization - used to initialize variable(s)
	condition - specifies the condition to go inside lopp or exit the loop
	updation - updates the variable, so that it won't go into infinite loop
*/

/*
	This for-loop will be executed until the condition is true.
  If condition is fasle, then flow will exit the loop.
*/

for (let i = 1; i<=5; i++) {
	console.log(i);
}
```

## While Loop

Syntax for while-loop

```jsx
 *          while (condition) {
 *              code to be iterated
 *              And updation too
 *          }
/*
 *      - Here, var will be initialized before the loop itself
 *      - condition - whether to enter the loop or exit the loop
 *      - updation is written inside the while block 
 */
 
let i = 1;
while (i<=5) {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
}
```

NOTE:

---

- All the code within the curly braces `{ }`, will be called while-block [ of code ]
- Similarly, for-block too
</aside>

## When to use for-loop & while-loop..?

- for-loop is used when we actually know No. of iterations
- While-loop is used when we donâ€™t know No. of iteration but know the condition to break loop.

## for-of Loop

- `for-of` statement â†’ loops through each value of an Iterable Object.

```jsx
/**
 *  for-of Loop:
    ------------
 *  The JavaScript for-of statement loops through the values of an iterable object.
 *      Syntax:
 *              for (variable of iterable) {
 *                  code block
 *              }
 *      - variable - name of the var [ we can (or) cannot declare var, that's NOT a problem ]
 *      - iterable - An object that has iterable properties like string, array...
 * 
 *  This for-of loop will be replacing all the 3 steps of for-loop with a single 'of' keyword
 */

let fruits = ["mango", "melons", "apple", "berries"];

for (i of fruits) {
    console.log(i);
}
/**
 *      - here, i is the variable [in this case, var is not declared]
 *      - fruits is the name of the iterable
 */

for ( let char of "Apna College") {
    console.log(char)
}
/**
 *      - here, char is the var [ in this case, we have declared the var ]
 *      - instead of iterable name, we have given the iterable itself "Apna College"
 */
```

## Loop Challenges

```jsx
// While loop to cal sum from 1 to 5 & store it in "sum" variable
let sum = 0;
let i = 1

while (i <= 5) {
    sum += i;
    i++;
}

console.log(sum);

// While Loop that counts down from 5 to 1 & store the Numbers in an Array "countdown"
let count = 5;
let countdown = [];

while (count > 0) {
    countdown.push(count);
    count--;
}

console.log(countdown);

// Use a do-while loop that prompts a user to eneter their fav food until they 
// enter "stop" && store each food item in an Array called "foodCollection"
let foodCollection = [];
let foodItem =  null;

do {
    foodItem = prompt("Enter your Favaorite Food ..!");
    if (foodItem != "stop") {
        foodCollection.push(foodItem);
    }
} while (foodItem != "stop");

console.log(foodCollection);

// Use a do-while loop that adds numbers from 1 to 3 & stores result in "total"
let total = 0;
let num = 1;

do {
    total += num;
    num++;
} while (num <= 3);

console.log(total);

// Write a for loop that multiplies each element in array [2, 4, 6] with 2 &&
// stores the result in new Array "multipliedNumbers"
let arr = [2, 4, 6];
let multipliedNumbers = [];

for (let i=0; i<arr.length; i++) {
    let tempEle = arr[i] * 2;
    multipliedNumbers.push(tempEle);
}

console.log(multipliedNumbers);

// write a for loop that lists all the cities in the array ["paris", "New York", "Tokyo", "London"] and
// stores each city in new array named "cityList"
let cities = ["paris", "New York", "Tokyo", "London"];
let cityList = [];

for (let i=0; i<cities.length; i++) {
    cityList.push(cities[i]);
}

console.log(cityList);
