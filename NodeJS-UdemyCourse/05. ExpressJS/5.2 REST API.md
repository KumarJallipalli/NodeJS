## Versioning

- `npm` follows Semantic Versioning
- Rules of Semantic versioning
    - `4.21.3`
        - `4` → Major Version
        - `21` → Minor Version
        - `3` → Patch Version
    - Patch
        - Incremented when there are some Bug fixes [ of existing features ]
        - No New Features are Added [ Only Bugs fixes ]
        - It’s Backward Compatible → Existing code will work fine [ Doesn’t Break Code ]
    - Minor
        - Incremented when new Features are Added
        - It’s Backward Compatible → Existing code will work fine [ Doesn’t Break Code ]
    - Major
        - Incremented when new Features/Changes which may break the Code are Added
        - It’s NOT Backward Compatible
        - Users need to update their Code to be Compatible with this Version [ else Code may break ]
    - `~4.21.3`
        - This `~` means → Automatic updating of Patch Versions only
    - `^4.21.3`
        - This `^` means → Automatic updating of both Minor & Patch Versions

## Rest API

- REST → Representational State Transfer
- API → Application Programming Interface
- `REST API` → is a set of rules for building [ and interacting ] with web services [ using HTTP ]
- It is an Architectural Style
    - [ REST API → API’s that follow architectural principles of REST ]
- Principles of REST API
    - All Communication happens on HTTP
    - follows Stateless
    - follows Client-Server Architecture
    - Cacheable

## Stateless

Stateless → No State is Maintained on the Server

- Server Doesn’t Store Session Data [ of User/Client ]
- Each Request is Independent & Contains all the data required for Server to process it
- Client/User Request data is NOT Stored on the Server
    - If you want to Store it, Store it in DB, Redis or somewhere else
- Why ?
    - Because, Servers in Realtime are scaled [ Scale up or down ]
    - In doing so, Stored Data won’t be available in all Servers
    - contradicting the functionality of Scaling

Statefull → Server Stores Session Data [ & uses it for further requests ]

- So, if the same Client sends another request,
- Server doesn’t need to auth & sends the response directly
