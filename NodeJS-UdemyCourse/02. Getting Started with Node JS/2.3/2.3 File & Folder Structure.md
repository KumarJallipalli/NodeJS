## `npm`

- `npm` is a software registry [ Worldâ€™s Largest Registry ] and
- `npm` **is default package manager for Node.js**,
    - `package Manager` â†’ used to **install, update, delete & manage dependencies (libraries, tools, and frameworks)** in JavaScript projects.

`npm` consists of three distinct components:

- the registry â†’ A large public database of JS Packages/Software's
- the website â†’ Used to discover & Public Packages
- the Command Line Interface (CLI) â†’ Used to Interact with `npm` from a Terminal

## How to make a Package

1. Go to root directory of the Project
2. Create `package.json` file
    - How to Create `Package.json`
        - run `npm init`
        - it creates a `package.json` file
3. Now the Project became a Package

## How to Install Packages

- run `npm install package_name`
    - This will search for the Package
    - Downloads the source code of the Package
    - And keeps the source code of the Package in a folder called `node_modules`
- A record of this installation is maintained in
    - `package.json`
    - `package-lock.json`

NOTE:

---

- Install `@types/node` package â†’ is a **TypeScript type definition package**
    - It provides **type definitions** for the Node.js runtime
    - So that you can use Node.js modules (like `fs`, `path`, `http`, etc.) with full IntelliSense, autocomplete, and type checking in TypeScript.
- This allows TypeScript to recognize built-in Node.js globals like:
    - `process`, `__dirname`, `Buffer`, Node modules like `fs`, `http`, `crypto`, etc.
- Shortly â†’ It gives auto suggestion & IntelliSense features for Node.JS

## Files & Folder Structure

**`package.json`**

- `package.json` â†’ is a configuration file which contains metadata about a Node.js project.
- It used to
    - Manage project dependencies
    - Define project metadata (name, version, etc.)
    - Set up scripts to automate tasks
    - Control versions and compatibility
- Properties [ As it is a JSON file ]
    - `main` â†’ Entry point of your app. [ Default is `index.js` ]
    - `scripts` â†’ Defines custom command-line scripts.
    - `dependencies` â†’ Essential Packages required to run the app [ in Production/runtime ]
    - `devDependencies` â†’ Packages/tools required only to develop, test or build the app

**`package-lock.json`** 

- It is an **automatically generated file** by `npm`
- `package-lock.json`  â†’ It Maintains Dependencies of the Dependencies [ i.e., Nested Dependencies ]
    - **And It locks the exact versions** of every installed package & itâ€™s nested dependencies.
- It ensures **consistent installs** across environments. [ i.e., everyone installs the exact same versions ]
- It is pushed to GitHub

**`node_modules`**

- `node_modules` is the **directory** which contains **all the installed dependencies** [ & their nested dependencies ] listed in `package.json`
- These dependencies/packages are installed & managed by `npm`
- `node_modules` folder gets created when you run `npm install`
    - When you run `npm install`, Node.js:
        - Reads `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.
        - Resolves the dependencies.
        - Installs the dependencies [ inside the `node_modules` folder ]
- `node_modules` is NOT pushed to GitHub
    - As it is Very Large
    - It can be get back by running `npm install`
        - As all these dependencies/packages are installed & managed by `npm` using `package.json`

**`public`**

- The `public` folder contains **static files** that are served directly to the browser.
- These files are NOT Processed by Build Tools [ Copied as it is ]

**`src`**

- The `src` folder contains all your **application Source Code**
- These files are Processed by Build Tools
