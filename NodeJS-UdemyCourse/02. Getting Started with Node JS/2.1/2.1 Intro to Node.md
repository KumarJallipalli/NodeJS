# 2.1 Intro to Node [ 22/08/2025 ]

## INTRO

Point 1:

- WKT, Browser only understand 3 things
    1. HTML [ Structure Part ]
    2. CSS [ Styling Part ]
    3. JS [ Functional Part ]
- Other than these above 3, Browser doesn‚Äôt understand anything
- That means, These are the 3 Languages
    - that builds the whole Websites
    - that builds the whole Internet

Point 2:

- JS can only be run inside Browser.
- But How Browser is able to run JS code ?
    - Because, when we download any Browser, a JS Engine is Automatically shipped along
    - Hence, every Browser will have a thing called JS Engine
    - Using this JS Engine, Browser is able to Parse & Execute JS code
- If this JS Engine is NOT there inside the Browser, Then Browser also won‚Äôt be able to execute JS code
- Hence, JS Engine is ONE that is responsible for Running/Executing the JS Code

Point 3:

- Can we run JS outside the Browser ?
    - NO, [ during it‚Äôs initial days ]
    - As JS Engine is Embedded into the Browser
    - We can only Run JS inside Browser
- This is the Limitation of JS ‚Üí JS cannot be run Outside of Browser
    - As JS Engine is only available inside the Browser

Point 4:

- V8 is one of the JS Engine developed by Google for Chrome Browser
- V8 is a Open Source and a C++ Program
- Major Advantage of V8 is, it can be embed into any C++ application
- So, ‚ÄúRyan Dahl‚Äù embedded V8 into a C++ Application & called it Node.JS
- Now This Node.JS can be run anywhere [ as it is a C++ App, which can talk with OS & then Hardware ]
- And so Finally, JS can be run outside the Browser using Node.JS

## Node JS

- `Node.js`  ‚Üí Node JS is a JavaScript Runtime Environment built on Chrome‚Äôs V8 JS Engine
- Node JS lets us Execute the JS code outside the Browser
- Node JS is Open Source & Cross-Platform
- Node JS has an Event-Driven Architecture capable of Asynchronous I/O [ aka Non-Blocking I/O ]

NOTE:

---

- Node.JS is NOT a Framework or Library
- Node.JS is JS runtime
</aside>

## Advantages

- Run JS outside browser
    - This gave rise to
        - Build web servers with JS
        - Build CLI Tools with JS
        - Build Desktop apps with JS
        - Build IOS and Android apps with JS
        - Build IoT and watch apps with JS

## Node Commands

- `node file_name` ‚Üí Execute the file
- `node --help` ‚Üí Help Document
- `node -v` ‚Üí Checks Node Version

## `node --watch`

- The `--watch` flag in Node.js ‚Üí Enables automatic reloading of the application when files change
    - When any imported module or dependency of `index.js` changes, Node will automatically restart the process.
- Syntax ‚Üí `node --watch file_name`

How It Works

- It watches **all dependencies** of the entry file.
- Restarts the process on change.
- It's a Simple & Basic alternative to tools like `nodemon`.

## Browser ( vs ) Node

- These 2 are totally 2 different Environments
- Both supports native JS [ ECMAScript standards ]
- Browser
    - Supports native JS + Browser API
    - Supports Window Object ‚Üí Browser API
        - Supports DOM manipulation [ using document object ]
        - supports alert [ using alert object ]
        - supports fetch
- Node
    - Supports native JS + Web API + FS + Extra features
    - Some of the major Browser API‚Äôs are rewritten & Implemented in Node as Web API‚Äôs
        - like `setTimeout`
