# E03: Global Object [ 03/02/2025 ]

---

## How to Write Code using Node JS..?

1. Using Node REPL
    - REPL → Read, Evaluate, Print & Loop
    - This Node REPL is very Similar to Browser’s Console Window
    - we can go inside Node REPL  mode using `node` command in the Terminal
2. Using Separate JS File
    - Write the Required Code in the JS file
    - Run it using `node file_name`

## Global Object

- In Browser,
    - The Global Object refers to `window` Object
    - This `window` Object is NOT a V8 Engine’s Object, It is Provided by Browser
    - In Browser, `this`, `self`, `frames` etc.. all of them points out to the same `window` Object
- In Node,
    - The Global Object refers to `global` Object
    - Similar to Browser, here also this `global` object is NOT a V8 Engine’s Object, It is Provided by Node JS
    - In Node, `this` doesn’t point to `global` Object
    - `this` in Node JS is an Empty Object `{}`
- In Global,
    - Since, there are multiple Global Objects across all the JS Runtime Environments wrt Browsers, Node etc..
    - Open JS Foundation proposed a Standard Global Object across all the JS Runtime Environments
    - This Standard Global Object is called `globalThis`
    - `globalThis` → refers to Global Object in their Respective JS Runtime Environments

```jsx
console.log(global);        // refers Global Object in Node
console.log(this);          // refers to Empty Object
console.log(globalThis);    // refers to Global Object in any JS Runtime Environment

console.log(globalThis === global);     // true
console.log(window === globalThis)      // true [ if Execute in Browser ]
```
